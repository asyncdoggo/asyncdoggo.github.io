                        It mean that the entire language is free to use and modify. You can download the source code of Python and modify it to suit your needs. This is one of the reasons why Python has a large community of developers.

                        Python is actually made using another programming language. This language is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" className="text-blue-500">C programming language</a>. The source code of Python is written in C.

                        The source code is the code that is written by the developers of Python. It is compiled into machine code <i>(an .exe file for windows)</i> that can be executed by the computer.
                        The python code that you write is read and executed by the Python interpreter (.exe file).

                        Python was created by <b>Guido van Rossum</b> and was first released in 1991. It was designed to be a language that is easy to read and write. The language was named after the British comedy show

                        The first version of Python was released in 1991. Python was a successor to the ABC language.

                        The first stable version of Python was released in 1994. This was Python 1.0.
                        Guido van Rossum continued to work on Python at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_for_National_Research_Initiatives" className="text-blue-500">Corporation for National Research Initiatives</a> (CNRI) and released Python 1.6 in 2000.

                        Python was always meant to be easy to use and learn. It was created to make programming accessible to anyone with basic literacy in English and Mathematics and maybe some computers (That's you!).

                        Python 2.0 was released in 2000. This was a major release that introduced features like garbage collection and Unicode support. Soon python 2.1 was released in 2001.
                        It was also the first version of Python that was released under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation" className="text-blue-500">Python Software Foundation</a>.

                        Python 3.0 was released in 2008. This was a major release that introduced some breaking changes. The Python community was divided between Python 2 and Python 3 for a long time.

                        For a while, Python 2 and Python 3 were maintained simultaneously. But in 2020, Python 2 was officially discontinued. This means that there will be no more updates or bug fixes for Python 2.
                        It was marked as <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/" className="text-blue-500">End of Life</a> (EOL).
