                        In simple words, Python is a programming language. It can be used to write programs that can be executed by a computer.

                        But that is not what makes Python special.
                        Python is special because of its simplicity and at the same time, its power.

                        You will hear people say that Python is a <b>high-level</b>, <b>interpreted</b>, and <b>general-purpose</b> programming language.

                    <p className="w-full pt-4  text-lg italic font-sans">

                            <b>High-level</b> means that Python is designed using human-readable syntax. When you write Python code, its structure is similar to how you would write English sentences. This makes Python more intuitive and easier to learn.
                        </p>

                        <p className="w-full pt-4  text-lg font-sans italic">
                            The high-level in technical terms means that Python is abstracted from the machine code. This is achieved by using an interpreter.
                            You will learn more about interpreters and how python works in further sections.

                            <b>Interpreted</b> means that Python code is executed line by line. This is different from languages like C++ or Java where the code is compiled first and then executed.
                        </p>

                        <p className="w-full pt-4  text-lg font-sans">
                            <b>General-purpose</b> means that Python can be used for a wide variety of tasks. You can use Python to make web applications, games, scientific applications, and much more.

                    Lets look at an important part of a Python program, you may have noticed that this blog is written with indentation.
                    An indentation is nothing but a <b>space</b> or a <b>tab</b> before a statement.
                </p>
                <CodeBlock code={`if 5 > 2:
    print("5 is greater than 2")`} />

                <p className="w-full pt-4  text-lg font-sans">
                    In the above code snippet, the print statement is indented.
                    This is because the <InlineCode code={"print"}/> statement is inside the <InlineCode code="if" /> block.
                    The indentation is used to define the scope of the if block.
                </p>

                <p className="w-full pt-4  text-lg font-sans">
                    A scope is a simple way to define the area where something is valid or accessible.
